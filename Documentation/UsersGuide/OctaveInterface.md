## Octave Interface

ResInsight provides a flexible interface to [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ "Octave").
This includes a set of Octave functions that communicates with a running ResInsight session, and set of features in ResInsight that makes it easy to manage and edit Octave scripts, and to execute them using Octave.  

The octave functions are documented in [ Octave Interface Reference](OctaveInterfaceReference.md)


### Script management 
Octave scripts are available in the **Scripts** folder in the **Project Tree**.

This folder contains an entry for each of the directories you have added as a **Script Folder**. Each of the folder lists available `*.m` files and sub directories. The tree is continuously updated to reflect the file structure on disk.

#### Adding Script Folders
You can add directories by right clicking the **Scripts** item to access the context menu.

Multiple standard script folder locations can also be defined in the field **Shared Script Folder(s)** in the **Preferences Dialog** (**Edit -> Preferences**). 

#### Editing scripts 
To enable script editing from ResInsight you need to set up the path to a text editor in the **Script Editor** field in the **Preferences Dialog** (**Edit -> Preferences**) 

When done, scripts can be edited using the context menu command **Edit** on the script item in the tree.

### Script execution
Octave scripts can be executed with or without a selection of cases as context. The [ Octave Interface Reference](OctaveInterfaceReference.md) highlights in more depth how to design your octave scripts to utilize these features.

#### Without a case selection 
A script can be started by navigating to the script in the **Project Tree**, and selecting **Execute** from the context menu. The currently active case (The one with the active 3D View) will then be set as ResInsight's *Current Case*. 

#### With a case selection
One script can be executed on many cases by first selecting a set of cases, and then activating **Execute script** from the context menu for the case selection. The script is then executed once pr selected case. Each time ResInsight's *Current Case* is updated, making it accessible from the Octave script.
