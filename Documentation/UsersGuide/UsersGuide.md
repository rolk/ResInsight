## Introduction

ResInsight is a tool for visualizing Eclipse Reservoir simulation related data, and aims to be 
fast, accessible, flexible and to present tools and visualization modes requested and designed by 
Reservoir engineers.

The main input data is
`*.GRID` and `*.EGRID` files along with their `*.INIT` and restart files `*.XNNN` and `*.UNRST`. 
ResInsight have some support for Eclipse input files, often called `.grdecl`, and can read grid 
information and the corresponding cell property data sets.

ResInsight also have support for extensive processing of the data sets through an interface to octave, and 
can also export modified cell property data sets to single Eclipse input files.
